Hi again. 
I am Ilkay Altinas. Just like Leo, I'd like to tell you

 a little bit about my work here 
at the San Diego Supercomputer Center

 
and UC San Diego.

 
You might even think, what does a supercomputer center

 
have to do with data science? Let me tell you.

 
As you might have heard, there are many different, 

exciting applications that are being enabled 
by data science in the big data era.

 I am the Chief Data Science Officer at SDSC,

 
leading our collaborative 
data science hub activities.

 
At the same time, I lead our research development 
and education division,

 
where I oversee many exciting research programs.
And a role that I am passionate about 
is my research center for data science workflows,

 
which I built over time as an area since the year 
which has been a 
joint SDSC at UC San Diego. In terms of some of my education activities,

 
I'm the Faculty Co-Director

 
for the Master of Advanced Studies Program

 
on Data Science 
and Engineering here at UC San Diego, 
in which I teach a capstone project course.

 
I also work as a lecturer

 
for the Computer Science and Engineering Department 

and have done big data courses

 as part of other online and offline course programs.

 What is common to all these roles

 is that I work on interdisciplinary research
As a part of my core research development

 
and teaching activities, I work on building methodologies

 
and tools to make big data, data science,

 and computational 
science useful 
to dynamic, data-driven scientific applications. 
I work with many UC San Diego centers in these areas.

 
My colleagues and I work on many Grand 
Challenge 
data science applications in all areas 
of science and engineering, including genomics,

 
geoinformatics, metro data science or smart cities,


energy management, 
biomedicine, personalized health, and many others as part of our data science hub. 
What is common to all these applications 
is their unique way of bringing together 

new modes of data and computing research. 
So it's all about collaboration

 
and what the supercomputer center brings to it 
as the computing and data management expertise.


So what do I do on a regular day,

 is to think about how I can get a group of very smart people

 
collaborate to solve data science challenges.

 
I worry about questions like,


how do we close the loop on data science methods, 
tools, computing and data systems, and domain experts? These questions also get translated to research challenges 
and toolboxes for data science by my research group.

 Our main goal is methodology and tool development

 
to build automated and operational workflow-driven

 
solution 
architectures on big data and high performance computing platforms.

 This applies to many scientific disciplines. 
Let me tell you a project we work on as a part 
of many 
of these applications. 
It is for wildfire analytics,

 
which breaks up into two components: 
prediction and emergency response. 
WIFIRE is a collaborative project

 
funded 
by the National Science Foundation

 
to build a cyberinfrastructure for wildfire monitoring, 
prediction, and resilience.

 
It's a research project, which lead to very 
useful insights.

 
In WIFIRE, we built a scalable cyberinfrastructure

 
that can utilize any high-end computing,

 
cloud and big data platform,

 
for dynamic big data fire 
modeling and prediction.

 
The approach here is to use real-time data

 to learn about the dynamics of fire behavior

 
and environment, and using data science techniques,

assimilate what we have learned into a fire model 
to adopt to changes in the situation over time. 
Here, data science methods and workflows 
were used for system integration

 

and dynamic application scalability. All the data, models, and computing systems 
being used for data before WIFIRE, 
but a programmable system integration that can match the 
application needs we're lacking.
Data science enables such computing capabilities 
to become available to fire response, research,

 
and planning communities.

 
In fact, the system 
is being used

 as a special awareness tool by some fire departments 
already and we are really happy about that.

 But WIFIRE represents a wide range of applications

 

where real-time big data can be assimilated 
with modeling and simulation tools 
for better situational awareness

 
and dynamic decision support. Just take a moment to 
imagine how data science

 will help with firefighting in the future. Many streams of data will come together in 3-D displays 
that can show all the related information 

along with weather and fire predictions.

 
That would be a great application of data science with societal impact.

 
Needless to say, none of this would be possible

 
without 
the collaboration of many individuals, 
showing how important interdisciplinary collaboration is 
to data science.

 
Hope you enjoyed hearing about what I do. 
And I'm looking 
forward to sharing 
some exciting data science use cases with you

 
over the next 10 weeks.
